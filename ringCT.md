# 🧠 What is RingCT in Monero?

RingCT stands for **Ring Confidential Transactions**.  
It's a privacy technology in Monero that hides the amount of money being sent in a transaction.

## 📦 Why is this important?

In Bitcoin or Ethereum, everyone can see:
- Who sent money
- To whom
- And **how much**

In Monero:
- Sender is hidden
- Receiver is hidden
- **Amount is hidden** – thanks to RingCT

## 🔍 How does RingCT work (Simply)?

RingCT uses **mathematical tricks** to prove that:
- You sent money
- You had enough balance
- You didn’t create money from nothing  
👉 Without showing the actual amount!

It’s like showing:
> "I paid you something valid, but I won’t say how much."

---

## 🧪 Bonus Example:

Imagine a crowd of 10 people. One of them paid for lunch.  
But everyone hides their wallet. You know **someone paid**, but you can’t tell who, or how much.

That’s how RingCT keeps Monero users private.

## 🤝 Who benefits?

- Journalists
- Activists
- Regular people in countries with surveillance
- Anyone who believes that **money = speech**
